To generate a two matricies for the program:
  -> compile the file numbers_gen.cpp in to an exicutable.
    -> run the file where the command line arguments are the size 
       then the range of numbers starting at zero
    i.e "./numbers_gen [size] [range]"
To run the calculator:
  -> complice the matrix_multiplication.cpp into an exicutable.
    -> run the exicuteable where the first command line argument 
       is the number of processors allocated to the program 
    i.e "./matrix_multiplication [number of processors]
